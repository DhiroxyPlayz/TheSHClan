    <h1>Meet MooMoo!</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is MooMoo, but some people call me Kay. You can call me whatever you like. I’m 23 years old, and in this server, I mainly observe, but I hope to have the opportunity to contribute more in the future.What I really appreciate about this community is that everyone is super friendly and open to conversation. It's a very positive environment where you can be yourself without fear of judgment. Plus, it’s drama-free! The entire staff team works really hard and is available 24/7, always ready to listen to any questions you may have.

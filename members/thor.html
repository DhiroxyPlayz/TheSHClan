    <h1>Meet Thor!</h1>

    <p>
        Hello there I'm Shadowhunter. Im the leader of the hunters.
<br><br>
        I'm 21 years old and I run a server on discord, I also stream on twitch. <br><br>

        My gender is male.<br><br>

        <span>Now what is it i do on the server/clan?</span><br>
        As you all know that I am the leader of the clan and tge owner of the server, I give tasks to my staff and hunters. <br>
        I am also the one who makes the final choice. However, I do rely on my staff since they are a big part of my team. Without them this clan wouldn't have gotten as far as it has. <br><br>

        To the ones that is wondering if im single or taken well i can tell you im happily taken by zaid.<br><br>

        Now have a great time reading the rest of the staff members little about me's or if you have read them already then have a great day and we cant wait to see you on the server.
    </p>

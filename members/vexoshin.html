    <h1>Meet VEXOSHIN!</h1>

    <p>
        Hiii! My name is VEXOSHIN and I'm the daughter to ShadowHunter ! ♥ <br><br>
        Gender & Pronouns: Genderfluid, any pronouns !<br><br>

        I'm a left hand to this server and I mostly give out ideas to the leader/my father.<br>
        I've also made the " #ꔫ-𝘐𝘯𝘵𝘳𝘰𝘥𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴✎-ꔫ " channel i think you should check out in the server. I've made some templates for you to use if you want to introduce yourself to us. ♥<br><br>

        I'm trying my best always to answer everyone and being active on the server when I feel like it.<br>
        ^.^

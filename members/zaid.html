    <h1>Meet Zaid!</h1>

    <p>
        Hello!!<br>
        I’m Zaid, one of the staff members in the Shadow Hunter Clan.<br><br>

        I’m 17 years old, I’m a female and go by She/Her/Hers!<br><br>


        Get to know me!<br><br>

        I personally love to be creative either with art, music, clothes or anything really. I also have a very big heart for nature, animals, family, and friends. I’m still in school, I study architecture and design. I have 1 cat at the moment, her name is Miyuki. She is such a sweetheart!<br><br>

        What do I do / What are my roles in the clan?<br><br>

        As I mentioned before, I'm one of the staff on this server.<br>
        I mostly run channels for mental health like #dailypositivity.<br>
        I also run the YouTube account together with other staff/the owner.<br>
        Sometimes I’m also there helping the other staff and owner with making decisions even though I personally am more focused on helping people feel okay one way or another!<br><br>

        Partner?<br><br>

        Yes, I am happily taken by the owner Shadowhunter. We are very happy together if I have to say so myself haha!<br><br>

        More questions?<br><br>

        If you ever want to know more about me I’d be more than happy to answer those questions for you. I do hope to see you soon on the server. Have fun reading the rest of the staff info and hopefully see YOU soon! -xx Zaid!
